\title{Clean Mesh by Removing Non-Contiguous Elements}
\usage{
clean_mesh(mesh)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{An \code{sf} object consisting of polygonal mesh elements (e.g., hydraulic model output).}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing only the mesh elements that are contiguous with the largest connected component.
}
\description{
This function removes disconnected (non-contiguous) polygons from a mesh, retaining
only those elements that share edges with the main, contiguous area of the mesh.
It assumes the largest contiguous polygon represents the main wetted channel or region of interest.
}
\details{
The function works by:
\enumerate{
\item Merging all mesh polygons into contiguous areas using \code{st_union}.
\item Selecting the largest merged polygon (by area), assumed to represent the main wetted region.
\item Filtering the original mesh to retain only polygons that intersect this main region.
}
This method ensures that polygons merely touching at a vertex (not an edge) are excluded,
which avoids over-selecting disconnected elements.

# mesh_cleaned <- clean_mesh(mesh)
