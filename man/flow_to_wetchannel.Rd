\title{Create Wetted Channel Polygon from TIN Mesh}
\usage{
flow_to_wetchannel(flow, depth_min, max_hole_area)
}
\arguments{
\item{flow}{An \code{sf} object representing a mesh with a \code{DEPTH} column indicating water depth.}

\item{depth_min}{Numeric. Minimum depth threshold used to differentiate between wet and dry areas.}

\item{max_hole_area}{Numeric. Maximum hole area threshold. Holes smaller than this value will be filled (removed).}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} polygon object representing the wetted channel, with small holes removed.
}
\description{
Extracts the polygon of the wetted area from a computational mesh using a depth threshold.
Optionally removes small holes from the resulting geometry.
}
\details{
The function flags all mesh elements with depth greater than or equal to \code{depth_min} as "wet", then groups and merges them
into a single polygon geometry. Holes smaller than \code{max_hole_area} are removed using \code{nngeo::st_remove_holes()}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'mesh' is an sf object with a 'DEPTH' column
wetted <- flow_to_wetchannel(mesh, depth_min = 0.1, max_hole_area = 2)
plot(wetted)
}
