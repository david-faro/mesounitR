\title{Compute supercells using a SLIC approach on hydraulic mesh data}
\usage{
elements_to_supercell(mesh, sc_area, compactness)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{An \code{sf} object representing a TIN mesh with numeric columns \code{DEPTH} and \code{VEL}.}

\item{sc_area}{A positive numeric value specifying the average target  area of each supercell.}

\item{compactness}{A positive numeric value controlling the compactness of supercells.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object with dissolved supercell polygons and averaged hydraulic statistics.
}
\description{
This function clusters elements of a computational mesh into supercells
based on hydraulic variables \code{DEPTH} and \code{VEL}, using a Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC)-like approach. It returns an \code{sf} object with supercell
geometries and statistics (mean and standard deviation) for hydraulic variables.
}
\details{
The function identifies initial cluster centers on a regular grid, computes
local averages of hydraulic variables in the vicinity of these centers, and
performs K-means clustering in a space combining spatial and hydraulic information.

The resulting supercells include:
\itemize{
\item \code{D_avg}, \code{D_sd}: Mean and standard deviation of water depth.
\item \code{V_avg}, \code{V_sd}: Mean and standard deviation of velocity.
\item \code{F_avg}, \code{F_sd}: Mean and standard deviation of the Froude number.
}

The Froude number is calculated as \code{VEL / sqrt(9.81 * DEPTH)}.
