\title{Evenly Space Points Along a Line}
\usage{
evenspace(xy, sep, start = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with two columns representing the x and y coordinates of a polyline.}

\item{sep}{Numeric. Distance (in CRS units) between consecutive points to be placed along the line.}

\item{start}{Numeric. Distance (in CRS units) from the start of the line at which to place the first point (default is 0).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\describe{
\item{x}{x-coordinates of the evenly spaced points.}
\item{y}{y-coordinates of the evenly spaced points.}
\item{x0}{x-coordinates of the segment's starting point.}
\item{y0}{y-coordinates of the segment's starting point.}
\item{x1}{x-coordinates of the segment's ending point.}
\item{y1}{y-coordinates of the segment's ending point.}
\item{theta}{Angle (in radians) of the segment direction, relative to the x-axis.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the coordinates of evenly spaced points along a polyline defined by a sequence of 2D points.
Useful for geometric processing, plotting, or spatial interpolation tasks where regular spacing is needed.
}
\examples{
# Define a polyline
xy <- matrix(c(0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
# Compute points every 0.5 units
evenspace(xy, sep = 0.5)
