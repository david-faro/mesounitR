The **mesounitR** software segments a river reach into a mosaic of
mesohabitats using a three-step process based on outputs from 2D
hydraulic modeling.

**Step 1:** Mesh elements from the hydraulic model, corresponding to
river elements, are up-scaled into supercells, corresponding
approximately to the scale of small hydraulic units (Fig. 1, A).

**Step 2:** Potential habitat configurations are explored across the
entire spatial spectrum, ranging from small hydraulic units
(micro-scale) to the reach (macro-scale) (Fig. 1, B).

**Step 3:** An optimal meso-scale configuration based on desired
meso-scale characteristics is selected by minimizing a Global Score
(Fig. 1, C). The Global Score is based on three metrics representing
intra-segment homogeneity, inter-segment heterogeneity, and an optimal
range of segment numbers based on an empirically defined meso-scale.

The workflow is river-independent and fully unsupervised, as it does not
require calibration or subjective choices of segmentation parameters.
